👓 Version 2.2.0
===========================================================================

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
⚠ Breaking Changes in 3.0.0
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Starting 3.0.0 `zz File Icons` will be renamed to `A File Icon`. I've found
the way how to fix/implement two annoying issues:

- Resolve conflicts with unsupported themes. So the right icons will be used
  after fixing this.

- Add possibility to use package icons if they missing in supported themes.
  If the theme developer doesn't want to add more icons, package will
  replace missing icons with provided by itself.

I have no plans to add new icons in 3.0.0, it will bring only the new way
of applying them. I apologize for any inconvenience caused.
