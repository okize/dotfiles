## Git Commit Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use git commit messages to generate **Sublime File Icons** change log. 

We use [**Angular JS commit guidelines**](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines) (except scope notes: we don't need them).

## Building

This package uses a custom Gulp builder. If you want to add new icons you must install it first:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then run the task to build the icon you've added:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Build process consists of:

* Build settings that are required for applying icons.
* Build SVG sources and move them to dist icons.

## Want to add new icons?

If you want to add a new icon, please follow these steps:

1. Try to find an icon in one of [these resources](https://github.com/oivva/sublime-file-icons#icons). We always try to be pretty similar to [Atom File Icons](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons) package. If you are unable to find anything â€“ add your own.
2. Add an example file that shows this icon to the `test` folder.
3. Provide the icon in SVG format and put it in the `src/assets` directory.
4. Add `icon` settings to the [src/icons.json](https://github.com/oivva/sublime-file-icons/blob/dev/src/icons.json) file.
5. Build and check if the icon looks good.
6. It's recommended to add a link to the package which provides the syntax (see [PACKAGES.md](https://github.com/oivva/sublime-file-icons/blob/dev/PACKAGES.md))

> All that you need to add are the SVG icon, its settings and the example file(s).

> All settings should be alphabetically sorted.

> Please do not change any other files - specially in `dist` folder.

### Icon

Requirements:

- The size should be `16x16` (`width`, `height` and `viewBox`).
- The color should be black via `i-color` class.
- You should build and check if it looks good. If not, make some tweaks to fit the pixel grid.

Example:

[![ActionScript Icon](https://cdn.rawgit.com/oivva/sublime-file-icons/dev/src/assets/file_type_actionscript.svg)](https://github.com/oivva/sublime-file-icons/blob/dev/src/assets/file_type_actionscript.svg)

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
  <defs>
    <style>
      .i-color {
        fill: #000;
        fill-rule: evenodd;
      }
    </style>
  </defs>
  <path id="file_type_actionscript.svg" class="i-color" d="M11.174,9.341A2.586,2.586,0,1,1,9.345,6.176,2.586,2.586,0,0,1,11.174,9.341Zm1.389-1.713A6.757,6.757,0,0,1,12.6,4.2,2.639,2.639,0,0,0,7.5,2.879,6.749,6.749,0,0,1,5.958,5.7a6.41,6.41,0,0,1-3,1.766,2.641,2.641,0,1,0,1.368,5.1,6.349,6.349,0,0,1,3.309-.016,6.782,6.782,0,0,1,2.985,1.776,2.611,2.611,0,0,0,3.609-.108,2.639,2.639,0,0,0,.09-3.631A6.786,6.786,0,0,1,12.562,7.628Z" transform="translate(0 -1)"/>

```

### Settings

Currently Sublime Text requires syntax definitions to apply icons. This means that you need to have the right syntax package to be able to see icons associated with the language. However we can abuse syntax definitions in order to provide different file icons to files with the same underlying syntax but different semantics (`Gulpfile.js`, `package.json` & etc.). That's why we provide two types of icons:

- Syntax (apply via syntax scope).
- Aliases (apply via syntax scope and syntax alias abuse).

For example:

```js
"file_type_git": {
  "color": "orange",
  "syntaxes": [
    {
      "name": "GitSyntaxes",
      "scope": "text.git"
    },
    {
      "name": "Git Misc Packages",
      "scope": "source.git"
    }
  ],
  "aliases": [
    {
      "name": "Shell Script (Git)",
      // `extensions` should be provided for aliases only
      "extensions": [
        ".gitignore",
        ".gitkeep"
      ],
      // It's the scope of the syntax which this alias inherits
      // `base` should be provided for aliases only
      "base": "source.shell",
      "scope": "source.shell.git"
    }
  ]
}
```

These settings will create three files after running the build: 

* `dist\languages\Shell Script (Git).tmLanguage`
* `dist\preferences\file_type_git.tmPreferences`

Git icons will be applied to files such as `.gitconfig`, `.gitmodules`, etc. when you install `GitSyntaxes` package. However this package doesn't provide syntaxes for `.gitignore` and `.gitkeep`. That's why `zz File Icons` creates syntax alias to `Shell Script` to use its highlighting and git icon on these files.
