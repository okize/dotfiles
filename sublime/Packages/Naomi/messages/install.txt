Congratulations on installing the most accurate and actively maintained syntax
definitions for sublime text! If you find any bug or have suggestions to improve
it, don’t hesitate to report here:

Also, if you find this project useful, don’t forget to star it on Github and
tell your friends about it, the more bug reports we get the better :D

After installing the plugin and restarting Sublime, it will automatically use
the syntaxes contained in this package.

You can also set them manually through:

  1. Go to the “View” menu;
  2. Then “Syntax”;
  3. Finally “Naomi”;

Or:

  1. Click at the bottom right corner where it shows the current syntax;
  2. Then “Naomi”.

Or:

  1. Open the Command Palette;
  2. Search for syntax, e.g. `Syntax JavaScript Naomi`;
