Options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit

                       only
  --head=HEAD          consider only the first N lines of each file
  --highlight          color by changing the background color instead of the

                       changes

  --show-all-spaces    color all non-matching whitespace including that which
                       is not needed for drawing the eye to changes.  Slow,
                       ugly, displays all changes
  --version            print version and exit
  --whole-file         show the whole file instead of just changed lines and
                       context
